Question 12 
Which initiatives can be added to ensure secure interaction between the database
and the web application? 

Start by following the MySQL Security guideleines: 
http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/security.html

Specifically, never give root access to anybody, and make sure that the web 
application has limited permissions to access the database and tables- no more 
privileges than necessary.  

Make sure MySQL is using the NEW password method for storing account hashes, 
and that the client accessing it supports it- use php-mysqli/php-mysqlnd and 
NOT the old php-mysql driver.  Most generic LAMP installations use the 
OLD_PASSWORD method.  If your web service and MySQL service run on the same 
local server, make sure to connect over a unix socket and donâ€™t expose MySQL 
to the network interfaces.

Next, the web application should talk to the database using an appropriate 
abstraction layer that has safety and sanitization built in (PDO, DBIterator, 
etc).  

Finally, don't write code that handles user input without cleaning, checking, 
and sanitizing it for safe insertion.
