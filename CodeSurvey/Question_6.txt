Question 7
Identify and explain the different security risks with the above statement. 

$query = "INSERT INTO new_table (name, city, zip) VALUES
    ('" . $_POST['name'] . "' , '" . 
    $_POST['city'] . "' , '" . 
    $_POST['zip'] . "' , ');";
    $info = DBModel::query($query); 

This code is a prime target for SQL Injection.  The POSTDATA received is neither 
checked nor verified, and is passed to the database without being properly 
escaped.  

An attacker could simply type in "mynameis;GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 
someunauthenticatedUser;"; in nay of these fields.

Second, input that hasn't been processed is also an infection vector for 
cross-site-scripting and Cross-Site Request-Forgery attacks.
