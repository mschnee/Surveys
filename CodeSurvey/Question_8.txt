Question 8
Identify and explain the different security risks associated with displaying the 
data as called above. 

$query = "SELECT * FROM new_table;";
$info = DBModel::query($query);
while ($row = mysql_fetch_assoc($info)) {
   echo $row['id'] . ": ";
   echo $row['name'] . ",  ";
   echo $row['city'] . " (";
   echo $row['zip'] . ")<br>";
} 

This code echos content directly to the web client without and validation, and 
is an infection vector for both Cross Site Scripting (XSS) attacks and Cross 
Site Request Forgery attacks.

If $row['name'] contains the following code:
"Matthew <script>$(window).bind(\"keypress\",someAjaxUploadFunction);</script>",
rendering it verbatim will install an in-session keylogger to anybody that loads 
that page.  This is the XSS vulnerability, according to Symantic was responsible
for 80% of all documented security vulnerabilities as of 2007:
