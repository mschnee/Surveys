Question 14
Using the class "DBModel", list all errors that are present in the class.

* mysql_query (line 17) is missing the second parameter, the connection 
  identifier to the database.
* DBModel::query() has a typo in the return variable name.
* DBModel::read() is private and isn’t used.
* DBModel::read() has '$this->table' which will be read literally, instead of 
  "{$this->table}" or by concatenating $this->table to the string.  
  Also, the member $this->table is empty and never set, which will cause MySQL
  to error.
* DBModel::read() doesn’t return any data when successful.  The errors should 
  be exceptions.

* __construct() doesn’t test if the connection was successfully established - 
  will throw an unhandled exception in mysql_select_db;
* This is a PHP 4 class, so I'm probably missing a lot.  'php -l' doesn't like
  it at all.
