Question 13
Using the class "DBModel", assuming the "query function" is corrected, how can 
the "query" function be used to hijack the database? 

function DBModel::query($sql){
     $returned_data = mysql_query($sql); 
     return $retruned_data; 
}

The query function writes a completely unfiltered string that may not even be
SQL.  Thankfully, mysql_query() doesn't allow multiple query statements, which
prevents an attacker from inserting a string like:
1;DROP TABLE users;

However, it could still allow a malicious user to modify the current query, 
allowing for blind SQL injection attacks.
